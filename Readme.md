# «Six pork's towns» (:pig_nose::pig_nose::pig::pig::pig::pig2:)

Future changes:
1. in the component ** comment.tsx ** there is a call to the DOM (for zeroing) - this should be removed
2. in several components the states remained inside, they must be moved to the HOC
3. some components (: grin: comment.tsx) do not have a state
4. split the reducer into modules: user, data, etc.
5. adding to favorites on the detailed information page does not work
6. the "Favorites" page is not completed yet
